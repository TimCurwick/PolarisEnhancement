# PolarisEnhancement

As of today, 5/15/18, this module works with the fork of Polaris at GitHub.com/TimCurwick/Polaris.

The fixes and enhancements in that fork will be merged into the Microsoft codebase shortly, at which point this module will work with GitHub.com/PowerShell/Polaris.

Much of the functionality of this module will also be merged into the main Polaris module at some point.

This module will continue to be supported and enhanced for any functionality that is not moved into the main Polaris module.
